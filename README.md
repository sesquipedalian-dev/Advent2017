# Advent2017
A little bit late, but this repository hosts my solutions for [Advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/2017).  Solutions are written in javascript and using a thin UI from react-native (including windows support).  I'm testing everything by running the universal windows app. 

# Running
* download repo
* do some shenanigans with NPM in the project directory to make sure it knows it's a project?
* react-native start 
* open windows/.SLN in visual studio community 2017
* start the .sln with or without debugging
* click on a day and provide input from the Advent of code site!
